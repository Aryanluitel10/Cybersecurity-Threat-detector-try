The Cybersecurity Threat Detector is a web-based tool I created to help users easily identify potential security risks in URLs and text snippets. It uses a hybrid analysis approach that starts with a rule-based engine to scan for common threat indicators like phishing keywords and suspicious domains. For a more detailed review, it also offers a “Deeper AI Analysis” feature that provides clear and easy-to-understand explanations of possible threats. The goal is to make cybersecurity analysis simple, insightful, and accessible for everyone.
